</div>


<p><span class="smcap">More</span> than eighty years ago, Davy first produced
and exhibited the arc-light to an admiring and
dazzled audience at the Royal Institution; and
forty years later, at the same place, Faraday, by
means of his memorable experiments in electro-dynamics,
laid down the laws on which the
modern dynamo-electric machine is founded.
Though known at the beginning of the century,
the electric light remained little more than a
scientific curiosity until within the last ten years,
during which period the dynamo-electric machine
has been brought to its present perfection, and
electric lighting on a large and economical scale
thus rendered possible. The first practical incandescent
lamps were produced only seven years
ago, though the idea of lighting by incandescence
dates back some forty years or more; but all
attempts to manufacture an efficient lamp were
rendered futile by the impossibility of obtaining
a perfect vacuum. The year 1881 will long be
remembered as that in which electric lighting
by incandescence was first shown to be possible
and practicable.</p>

<p>The future history of the world will doubtless
be founded more or less on the history of
scientific progress. No branch of science at
present rivals in interest that of electricity, and
at no time in the history of the world has any
branch of science made so great or so rapid
progress as electrical science during the past five
years.</p>

<p>And now it may be asked, where are the
evidences of this wonderful progress, at least in
that branch of electricity which is the subject of
the present paper? Quite recently, the wonders
of the electric light were in the mouths of
every one; while at present, little or nothing is
heard about it except in professional quarters.
Is the electric light a failure, and are all the
hopes that have been placed on it to end in
nothing? Assuredly not. The explanation of
the present lull in electric lighting is not far to
seek; it is due almost solely and entirely to
speculation. The reins, so to say, had been
taken from the hands of engineers and men of
science; the stock-jobbers had mounted the
chariot, and the mad gallop that followed has
ended in ruin and collapse. Many will remember
the electric-light mania several years ago, and the
panic that took place among those holding gas
shares. The public knew little or nothing about
electricity, and consequently nothing was too
startling or too ridiculous to be believed. Then
came a time of wild excitement and reckless
speculation, inevitably followed by a time of
depression and ruination. Commercial enterprise
was brought to a stand-still; real investors lost
all confidence; capital was diverted elsewhere;
the innocent suffered, and are still suffering;
and the electric light suffered all the blame.
The government was forced to step in for the
protection of the public; and the result of their
legislation is the Electric Lighting Act, which
authorises the Board of Trade to grant licenses
to Companies and local authorities to supply
electricity under certain conditions. These conditions
have reference chiefly to the limits of
compulsory and permissive supply, the securing
of a regular and efficient supply, the safety of
the public, the limitation of prices to be charged,
and regulations as to inspection and inquiry.</p>

<p>That the electric light has not proved a
failure may be gleaned from a rough survey of
what has been done during the past two years,
in spite of unmerited depression and depreciation.
In this country, permanent installations have
been established at several theatres in London
and the provinces; the Royal Courts of Justice,
the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace,
Windsor Castle, the Bank of England, and other
well-known buildings; while numerous railway
stations, hotels, clubs, factories, and private mansions
throughout the country, have also adopted
the new light either entirely or in part. In
addition to this, over forty steamships have been
fitted with the electric light during the past
year; and the Holborn Viaduct, with its shops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">{626}</span>
and buildings, has been lighted without interruption
for the past two years. On the continent,
in addition to a large number of factories, private
houses, and public buildings, numerous theatres
at Paris, Munich, Stuttgart, Brunn, Vienna,
Berlin, Prague, and Milan have been electrically
lighted. In New York, an installation of ten
thousand lights has been successfully running
for the last year or two. Any one wishing
to see the electric light to advantage and
its suitability to interior decoration, should
visit the Holborn Restaurant. This building,
with its finely decorated rooms, its architectural
beauties, and ornamental designs in the renaissance
style, when viewed by the electric light,
is without doubt one of the chief sights of
London.</p>

<p>The electric light in the form of the well-known
powerful and dazzling arc-light is the
favourite illuminant for lighting harbours, railway
stations, docks, public works, and other
large spaces. But it is to the incandescent
lamp that one must look par excellence for
the ‘light of the future.’ It has been satisfactorily
established that lighting by incandescence
is as cheap as lighting by gas, provided that it
be carried out on an extensive scale.</p>

<p>Very contradictory statements have from time
to time been published as to the relative cost
of lighting by electricity and gas; and a few
remarks on the subject, without entering into
detailed figures, will explain much of this
discrepancy. These remarks will refer to electric
lighting by incandescence.</p>

<p>In the first place, the lighting may be effected
in one of three ways—(1) by primary batteries;
(2) by dynamo-machines; or (3) by a combination
of dynamo-machines and secondary batteries.
The expense of working with primary batteries
is altogether prohibitory, except in the case of
very small installations; while secondary batteries
have not yet been made a practical success; so
that the second method mentioned above is the
only one at present in the field. In the second
place, a distinction must be made between isolated
installations and a general system of lighting
from central stations. Up to the present time,
nearly all the lighting by electricity has been
effected by isolated installations. If every man
requiring one hundred or even several hundred
lights were to set up his own gas-works and
supply himself from them, the cost of lighting
by gas would be enormously increased. Hence
it is manifestly unfair to compare the cost of
electric light obtained from isolated installations
with gas obtained from gas-works supplying
many thousands of lights; yet this is being
constantly done. Central stations supplying at
least, say, ten thousand lights, and gas-works on
an equal scale, must be compared in order to
arrive at a true estimate of the relative cost
of electricity and gas. Several such extended
installations are now being erected in London
and elsewhere. With improved generating
apparatus, and above all, with improved lamps,
it is confidently anticipated that the electric
light will eventually be cheaper than gas.
Even if dearer than gas, it will be largely used
for lighting dwelling-houses, theatres, concert-halls,
museums, libraries, churches, shops, show-rooms,
factories, and ships; while perhaps gas
may long hold its own as the poor man’s friend,
since it affords him warmth as well as light.</p>

<p>The incandescent light is entirely free from
the products of combustion which heat and
vitiate the air; it enables us to see pictures
and flowers as by daylight; it supports
plants instead of poisoning them, and enables
many industries to be carried on by night
as well as by day. Add to this an almost
perfect immunity from danger of fire and no
fear of explosion. When it is realised that a
gas flame gives out seventeen times as much
heat as an incandescent lamp of equal light-giving
power, and that an ordinary gas flame
vitiates the air as much as the breathing of ten
persons, some idea may be formed of the advantage
of the electric light from a sanitary point
of view. To this may be added absence of injury
to books, walls, and ceilings. Visitors to the
Savoy Theatre in London will doubtless have
seen the adaptability of this light for places of
public amusement, and it is now possible to
sit out a play in a cool and pleasant atmosphere
without incurring a severe headache. To
theatrical managers the light offers in addition
unusual facilities for producing spectacular effects,
such as the employment of green, red, and
white lamps to represent night, morning, and
daylight. The freedom from weariness and lassitude
after spending an evening in an electrically
lighted apartment must be experienced in order
to be appreciated. The electric light very readily
adapts itself to the interior fittings and decorations
of houses and public buildings, and it can
be placed in positions where gas could not be
used on account of the danger of fire. The old
lines of gas-fittings should be avoided as far as
possible, and the lights placed singly where
required, and not ‘bunched’ together. For the
lighting of mines, electricity must stand unrivalled,
though little has as yet been done in this
direction. Its speedy adoption either voluntarily
or by Act of Parliament, with the employment of
lime cartridges instead of blasting by gunpowder,
will in the future render explosions in mines
almost an impossibility. In some cases, gas may
yet for some time compete with the electric light
both in brilliancy and economy; for the electric
light has spurred on the gas Companies to the
improved lighting of many of our public streets
and places.</p>

<p>With the general introduction of electricity
for the purpose of lighting comes the introduction
of electricity for the production of power;
for the same current entering by the same conductors
can be used for the production of light
or of power, or of both. The same plant at
the central stations will supply power by day
and light by night, with evident economy.
Electricity will thus be used for driving sewing-machines,
grinding, mixing, brushing, cleaning,
and many other domestic purposes. In many
trades requiring the application of power for
driving light machinery for short periods, electricity
will be of the greatest value, and artisans
will have an ever ready source of power at their
command in their own homes.</p>

<p>Is electricity to supersede gas altogether? By
no means, for gas is destined to play a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">{627}</span>
important part in the future than it has done
in the past. Following close upon the revolution
in the production of light comes a revolution in
the production of heat for purposes of warming
and cooking, and for the production of power.
Gas in the future will be largely used not
necessarily as an illuminant, but as a fuel and a
power producer. When gas is burned in an
ordinary gas flame, ninety-five per cent. of the
gas is consumed in producing heat, and the
remaining five per cent. only in producing light.
Gas is far more efficient than raw coal as a
heating agent; and it is also far cheaper to
turn coal into gas and use the gas in a gas-engine,
than to burn the coal directly under
the boiler of a steam-engine; for gas-engines
are far more economical than steam-engines.
Bearing these facts in mind, it cannot but be seen
that the time is not far distant when, both by
rich and poor, gas will be used as the cheapest,
most cleanly, and most convenient means for heating
and cooking, and raw coal need not enter
our houses; also that gas-engines must sooner
or later supersede steam-engines, and gas thus
be used for driving the machine that produces
the electricity. In the case of towns distant
not more than, say, fifty miles from a coal-field,
the gas-works could with advantage be placed
at the colliery, the gas being conveyed to its
destination in pipes. Thus, coal need no longer
be seen, except at the colliery and the gas-works.
With the substitution of gas for coal,
as a fuel, will end the present abominable and
wasteful production of smoke. When smoke,
‘blacks,’ and noxious gases are thus done away
with, life in our most populous towns may
become a real pleasure. Trees, grass, and
flowers will flourish, and architecture be seen
in all its beauty. Personal comfort will be
greatly enhanced by the absence of smuts, ‘pea-soup’
fogs, and noxious fumes; and monuments,
public buildings, and pictures saved from premature
destruction.</p>

<p>The present method of open fires is dirty,
troublesome, wasteful, and extravagant. With
the introduction of gas as a heating agent, there
will be no more carting about of coals and
ashes, and no more troublesome lighting of fires
with wood, paper, and matches. No more coal-scuttles,
no more smoky chimneys, no more
chimney-sweeps! On the other hand, the old
open coal-fire is cheerful, ‘pokable,’ and conducive
to ventilation; while the Englishman
loves to stand in front of it and toast himself.
All this, however, may still be secured in
the gas stoves of the future, as any one could
easily have satisfied himself at the recent Smoke
Abatement Exhibition in London. The gas stove
of the future must be an open radiating stove,
and not a closed stove, which warms the air by
conduction and convection chiefly, and renders
the air of a room dry and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>It has frequently been pointed out that our
coal-fields are not inexhaustible; but they doubtless
contain a sufficient supply for hundreds of
years to come. Long before the supply is likely to
run short, other sources of nature will be largely
drawn upon. These are the winds, waterfalls,
tides, and the motion of the waves. The two
former have to some extent been utilised; but
little or nothing has been done or attempted
with the latter. Before these can be to any
extent made use of, means must be devised
for storing energy in the form of electricity, a
problem which is now being vigorously attacked,
but as yet without much practical success. That
electricity has a great future before it cannot for
a moment be doubted.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER L.—A CROW TO PLUCK.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two men stared at each other—Mr Hadleigh
with an expression of stern inquiry; Caleb with
a sullen audacity which failed to conceal the
confusion and disappointment he felt. But he
made no attempt to apologise, to explain, or to
retreat.</p>

<p>After a brief inspection of the man, Mr
Hadleigh was reassured: this was no common
burglar he had to deal with, and no immediate
violence was to be feared.</p>

<p>‘My good man,’ he said calmly, ‘you have
wasted your time and labour if you expected to
find money or plate here. That safe, which you
see is open, contains my cheque-books; but they
are worthless to you without my signature. As
for what plate and jewels there may be to
reward your adventure, they are in different
parts of the house, and before you can leave
this room to seek them you must murder me.
And before you do that, I shall sound this
alarm.’</p>

<p>As he spoke he took up a green cord which
lay beside his desk. The cord communicated
with a bell in the butler’s room, which if rung
at that time of night would certainly have
aroused the household.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t come here to rob; I didn’t expect
to find <i>you</i> in this room, and I don’t mean to
hurt you.’</p>

<p>Gruff and surly as Caleb’s manner was,
Hadleigh, even in that moment of peril, did
him justice.</p>

<p>‘I believe you, Kersey,’ he said quietly; ‘and
to prove it, I shall sit down and listen to what
explanation you have to give. Something very
unusual there must be to have caused you to
act as you have done. I told you at the end
of the harvest that if I could serve you at any
time, I should be pleased to do so. Is that
why you have come?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ was the sulky answer.</p>

<p>Although tortured by passion, Caleb was not
only sensible of the confidence which Mr Hadleigh
showed him under such peculiar circumstances,
but felt his self-respect raised by it, and was
wishful to make matters clear. The thing
somehow stuck in his throat, for he who had
broken into the house at midnight had to tell
this man of his son’s guilt—as he believed—and
of Pansy’s shame.</p>

<p>‘Then what did bring you here and in such
an outrageous fashion?’</p>

<p>‘I thought to find your son Mr Coutts here.
I’ve been waiting for him nigh on six hours.
When he came, he wouldn’t tell me the truth,
wouldn’t wait to speak to me, and I am determined
that he shall—not only speak to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">{628}</span>
this night, but speak true. I thought I heard
him hollering to me from that window. I
didn’t want to make a row if it could be helped,
so I got a ladder and came in, meaning to ask
him to do things straight and quiet. That’s
all.’</p>

<p>As Coutts’s room was above the library, Mr
Hadleigh comprehended the mistake Caleb had
made, and was satisfied that no intention of
robbery had brought him there. His own intense
preoccupation had prevented him from observing
any disturbance.</p>

<p>‘What is it you wish him to speak truth
about?’ he inquired.</p>

<p>‘I’d rather speak to himself,’ was the gloomy
response.</p>

<p>‘You are aware that breaking into the house
in this way might be an awkward thing for you
if brought before a magistrate. But since the
matter is important enough to induce you to
run the risk you have done to-night, you had
better take me into your confidence. I have no
doubt of being able to assist you.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ said Caleb, after another minute
of hesitation, and the blood tingling in his
honest cheeks on her account, ‘I want to know
what he has done with Pansy Culver.’</p>

<p>‘What can he have to do with the girl?’</p>

<p>‘More than I care to think—more, maybe,
than you would care to learn. He has wiled
her away from home and won’t tell me where
she is.’</p>

<p>‘There must be some stupid mistake here,
Kersey. Mr Coutts Hadleigh is too careful of
his reputation to perpetrate such a monstrous
act. On what grounds do you accuse him?’</p>

<p>Bluntly and speaking with less difficulty now
that the ice was broken, Caleb gave his reasons
for believing Coutts guilty—what he had observed
at their chance meetings, and particularly her
rejection of himself after she had led him to
think that she favoured him. Mr Hadleigh
allowed him to tell his story to the end without
interruption. He could see that the man was
blinded by jealousy and rage, was unconsciously
exaggerating trifles, and distorting them into
proofs of his foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>‘It is fortunate that accident has made me
the first hearer of this accusation,’ he said
calmly, when Caleb stopped. ‘I had little
doubt from the first that you were labouring
under a delusion: I am now convinced of it.
I will undertake to convince you of it in the
morning, if you will be advised and remain
quiet to-night.’</p>

<p>‘I won’t wait till morning—I’ll have it out
of him now. Where is he?’</p>

<p>‘Stay where you are, sir!’ said Mr Hadleigh
authoritatively, as Caleb made a movement
towards the door. ‘If you have no care for
yourself, you must have some for the girl. A
brawl between you and my son on her account
would disgrace her for ever.’</p>

<p>Caleb halted as if his feet were suddenly
clamped to the floor. For the first time, he
saw the danger with which his impetuous
conduct threatened the being he wished to
save.</p>

<p>‘What am I to do, then?’ he asked with more
humility in his manner than he had yet displayed.</p>

<p>‘What I have told you. Wait as patiently
as you can till the morning. Be here at eight
o’clock, and I promise to have everything explained
to your satisfaction without causing the
girl annoyance.’</p>

<p>‘It’s kind of you to think of that, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Show your gratitude by doing what I tell
you. Go back the way you came; if you
mounted by a ladder, return it to its proper
place; and when you come in the morning
bring Culver with you.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t speak to him about it until I know
she is safe.’</p>

<p>‘There is no need. You have only got to
say he is wanted here. It is better you should
take the message than one of the servants. The
less gossip we have the more likely the girl is
to escape scandal. Good-night.’</p>

<p>‘Good-night, and ... thank you kindly.’</p>

<p>The Agitator had never imagined that there
would come a day when he should be compelled
to speak such words of gratitude to the owner
of Ringsford. He obeyed his commands slowly
but faithfully: all sense of humiliation was
stifled by the knowledge that whatever might
be the upshot of the meeting in the morning,
the advice given him was sound, and that in
adopting it, he was rendering the best service
to Pansy.</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh knew that he had conquered
the man, and did not think it necessary even
to look at him as he parted the heavy hangings
and stepped out on to the balcony. A few
minutes after the window had closed, however,
he bolted it. That operation had been forgotten
by himself during the evening, and had not
been performed by the servant, who had instructions
on no account to enter the library unless
the bell rang.</p>

<p>Resuming his seat at the desk, Mr Hadleigh
completed the task in which he had been so
unpleasantly interrupted. He sealed the two
envelopes, and placed them in the drawer of the
safe, which he locked.</p>

<p>‘I have done with these things now,’ was his
mental observation, and yet he lingered over the
words, as if reluctant to pledge himself that he
should not again look at those records of a sad
life. With more firmness he said presently: ‘I
shall not look at them again.’</p>

<p>He drew a curtain aside and looked out. The
moon was shining dimly through a haze; the
white space before him looked like ghostland,
and it was peopled for him by ghosts of blunders
in the past and of hopes disappointed or relinquished
as unattainable. If we could live our
lives over again! What use?—unless we could
start with the bitter experience which inspires
the wish. Then how steadily we might steer
through the shoals of folly, passion, and falsehood.</p>

<p>In that still ghostland on which he was gazing,
there rose a new phantom offering comfort.</p>

<p>‘I will find my happiness in fostering theirs,’
he said, as he turned from the window, and with
hands clasped behind him, head bowed, began
to walk up and down the room.</p>

<p>Here happened one of those trifles which make
and mar existence. He was tripped by a hassock
and fell: in falling, his temple struck the corner
of the table, and he lay insensible. About the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_629">{629}</span>
same time there was a strange sound outside
like the distant boom of a heavy sea rushing
upon a shingly beach: it was the wind forcing
its way through the snow-laden trees of the
Forest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Caleb Kersey had reached the village, his
hand was on the latch of his lodging, when
looking backward, he saw a red glare in the
hazy atmosphere. The terrible word ‘Fire!’
rose to his lips, and his landlord—Dr Joy’s successful
pupil in the science of economy—heard
him. The alarm spread through the village
with mysterious rapidity, and whether moved
by a desire to render assistance, or mere curiosity
and a craving for any unusual excitement
which might break the monotony of their lives,
groups of men, women, and boys were soon
tramping through the snow in the direction
of the blaze. The little engine of the village
volunteer fire brigade was dragged from its
shed, and with a shout the lads started to the
rescue.</p>

<p>There had been much rick-burning during the
past few months, and it was at first supposed
that this was another outrage or accident of the
same kind. But the wonder grew, and the pace
was quickened when it became known, from messengers
who were riding in search of assistance,
that it was Ringsford Manor-house which was
on fire.</p>

<p>Already there were people at the scene of
disaster, and as the broad flames shot out from
windows and roofs, there were murmurs of wonder
such as one hears at a display of fireworks. The
murmurs, however, were those of terror. The
luminous glare cast a blood-red shade over the
white ground; the snow quickly dissolved, and
was trampled into a black puddle by the feet
of the gathering crowd.</p>

<p>The fire had got complete possession of the
building before it had been discovered. Still,
gangs of men were passing buckets of water
from the wells, which others heaved on the
burning mass; whilst Coutts was vainly exerting
himself with an ‘extincteur.’</p>

<p>Eager questions passed from mouth to mouth
as to the servants and family. All were safe
except one—the master of the house, and it was
feared he had perished.</p>

<p>Four men bearing a ladder came running from
the direction of the stables. The ladder was
placed against the portico, which protected it
somewhat from the fire. Three of the men drew
back from the scorching heat; the fourth, whose
form reflected by the light was like that of a
giant, dipped a big handkerchief in a bucket
of water and fastened it over his mouth. That
done he ascended the ladder and reached the
balcony. He tried to open the nearest window,
but it was fast, and a slight murmur of dismay
rose amongst those who watched the rescuer.
Placing his shoulder against the casement, he
with one vigorous heave burst it open and disappeared.</p>

<p>Suspense lengthened ten minutes into an hour.
The man came out carrying another in his arms,
and all knew that the other was Mr Hadleigh.
The rescuer reached the ladder: instead of
descending step by step, he twined his legs
round it and slid down, sailor fashion, supporting
his burden with the right arm and steadying
himself with the left.</p>

<p>It was one of those feats of combined daring,
courage, strength, and agility which always win
the heart of a crowd, and he was greeted with
as hearty a cheer as if he had saved the life of
their best friend, instead of one who was at ordinary
times no favourite. Nevertheless, there
were not wanting expressions of sympathy when
the report went round that Mr Hadleigh was
dangerously burned, and unconscious.</p>

<p>The young ladies and some of the female
domestics had taken refuge in the gardener’s
cottage, and thither Mr Hadleigh was conveyed,
whilst messengers were despatched for Dr Guy
and Dr Joy.</p>

<p>By this time the engines from Kingshope and
Dunthorpe were at work. The fire had raged
within the house for some time before the roof
fell; now it came down with a great crash, and
the melting snow aided the engines in checking
the extension of the flames to the right wing;
but it was long doubtful whether or not that
portion could be saved. To this object all efforts
were now directed, and there were constant relays
of willing hands to work the pumps. By daylight
the blackened walls of the main building
remained standing, with a smouldering heap
inside. Thanks to a thick wall between it and
the right wing, the latter had sustained relatively
little damage.</p>

<p>The first question asked by the county police
was how had the fire arisen. No one could guess,
until Coutts Hadleigh said briefly:</p>

<p>‘I believe it was that ruffian, Caleb Kersey.’</p>

<p>He stated his reasons for the surmise, and
Caleb was arrested that day on suspicion.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> Brennus shouted on the banks of the
Allia, and the Romans made into a proverb after
him, history has re-echoed ever since in deeds
as well as in words. ‘Woe to the conquered!’ is
traced in letters of blood on the sable lining of
the golden shield, of which the legend in front,
written in lines of light, is ‘Hail to the victor!’
‘Væ victis!’ is the discordant echo of ‘Io
triumphe!’ Woe to the conquered has been the
experience of all who have fought either for a
principle or a cause; a strip of land to add to the
imperial territory, or for the integrity and freedom
of the country and for dear life itself. Strike
and spare not; kill all, even to the babes and
sucklings, the aged men and the young women;
tread under foot those who are prostrate; leave
to perish by the wayside those who have fallen
out from the ranks—væ victis! woe to the conquered,
and death to the weak; but hail to the
victor, and increase of power to the strong! So
goes the world; so has it ever gone in the moral
life as well as in the physical; the struggle for
existence being as true of thoughts as it is of
races.</p>

<p>We must remember the heroic past, when
haply times are a little hard to ourselves, and
we are bound to suffer in the comparatively mild
way of modern days. We have to fight our fight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">{630}</span>
whatever it may be, as the heroes of old fought
theirs, till our cause conquers, or we are convinced
that we are on the wrong—not the weaker—side.
But till then, we have to endure private loss
that humanity may have greater gain; and to
remember that conscience is better than victory,
and that truth has ever been buffeted before
she has been crowned.</p>

<p>The world has this cruel cry for others beside
the pioneers and martyrs of a cause. If nothing
succeeds like success, so nothing is so fatal as
failure; and væ victis! is in truth the sentence
recorded against those whose fortunes fail, whose
card-houses tumble to pieces, and whose flapping
wings of ambition prove themselves to have
waxen attachments, which melt in the using and
land the poor highflyer in the mud. That fatal
settling-day on ’Change: that bad debt made
through the bank, and added to indefinitely,
on the theory of possible redemption if enough
time were allowed and enough rope paid out:
that terrible spell of ill-health which prevented
the completion of the book, the painting
of the picture, the execution of the order: that
failure, that fiasco—and væ victis as the commentary!</p>

<p>Væ victis! to the unhappy—to those vanquished
by pain and cast down by sorrow.
Only a very few compassionate souls care to
give their time and strength to the miserable
who sit in darkness ever unlifted, and
with ashes never shaken off their bowed and
melancholy heads. We naturally like the light
better than the dark; and perfumed pomade,
beneath rosebuds and fine feathered caps, is a
more pleasant thing than ashes taken out of
the grate and scattered over our hair. We get
tired of enduring sorrow. At first, we are keenly
sympathetic; but as time goes on, we wonder
why the wound does not heal. Our own sympathetic
pain has passed long ago; why cannot
that of their real hurt? They are always so
sad! They take no pleasure in the last fashion,
the newest gossip, that good story which is going
the round of society, or that smart saying of
the ill-natured wit, whose epigram rips the skin
from the flesh of his victim as neatly as if it
were a rapier. They are always so dull, these
poor creatures—it is really impossible to go and
see them! Væ victis! They are conquered by
grief, by loss, by pain; and they must suffer,
as all those who are overcome have to learn
how.</p>

<p>Væ victis! to the outspoken who cannot back
their words by that kind of substantial evidence
which passes by the name of legal proof. Thus
they are in the power of those against whom
they sought to warn the unwary and enlighten the
blind. If they cannot so back their words with
legal proof, they are conquered, and have to suffer
the fate of the conquered—in the law-courts this
time, as a change from the battlefield; and with
such punishment as belongs to the law of libel
to inflict. All the same it was maybe no libel,
no falsehood, but the absolute truth that they
said; but all the same, too, truth which is only
a moral certainty and not a substantive fact to
be demonstrated by undeniable evidence, is not
to be said without danger, and væ victis! to those
who cannot substantiate it. By which we are
taught the lesson of that silence which is golden;
and, in private things, the wisdom of not interfering
in the affairs of others. As the Italian
proverb has it: ‘A fool knows his own affairs
better than a wise man knows those of others;’
and again another: ‘He knows much who, knowing
nothing, knows how to keep silent.’ A great
deal of trouble is made for ourselves by this
interference in the affairs of others. But it is
difficult not thus to interfere, when we see all
awry, things which we think a few honest words
would put straight. But we must look out for
signal discomfiture, unless we can hold the reins
we seek to clutch, and make those with whom
we have intermeddled see according to our lights
and act according to our judgment. If their will
is stronger than ours, it is væ victis! to us in good
sooth!—with the not over-pleasant reflection, that
we have pulled that pot of boiling water over
ourselves, and in not letting comparative well
alone, have stirred it into active ill.</p>

<p>Væ victis! to the unsuccessful aspirant, whether
it be for honours, a pass, a post, or for love. No
one really pities him. He who droops on the
way and falls short in his stride is passed by,
and the triumphant reach the goal amid the
plaudits of the crowd. Who cares to console a
failure? to reconstruct a ruined cloud-tower? to
follow after a fading rainbow? Væ victis! and
let the pale illusions of a dead hope lie where
they have fallen! The poor fellow was rejected,
was he? Well, he really ought to have been
more sure of success before he made the effort!
Perhaps he was led on, as you say; but even
so, this does not excuse him, nor in any way
affect the principle of quasi-certainty before the
attempt. When you hazard a great stake, you
ought at least to know how to throw the dice, and
to be sure that you have counted your cards.
It is no use rushing darkly into enterprises for
which one has not the material; and to offer
one’s self for a place, whether of love or honour,
without having taken pains to measure one’s
strength against those forces which oppose, is to
be more rash than brave, and more foolish than
energetic. To be sure, no one can have who does
not try. That is true for itself. But it none the
more softens the verdict of the world for him who
has failed, nor deadens the echo of the cry raised
against him. If we do not try, we cannot get;
but woe to those who try—and fail!</p>

<p>Væ victis! also to the stupid, to the poor,
to all born conquered by fate even before
they have begun to strive with fortune—who
are thrust into the battle unlearned and heavily
weighted or ever the lists are set. Who pities
the dunce? Who cares to realise all the days
and hours of hopeless endeavour to get those
facts, that task, rooted in the sluggish brain? Is
it his fault, poor dunce, that the atoms are slow
to move? the nervous fluid insufficient to stir?
the blood too thick to run or too poor to animate?
He does his best; but as a schoolboy he gets
flogged, as well as over-tasked; as a man he gets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">{631}</span>
distanced, and perhaps ruined, unless he has the
luck of hereditary bread with butter superadded.
But what is not his fault, is nevertheless accounted
to him for blame; and because he is a dunce, he
has recorded against him the sentence of disfavour.</p>

<p>What else, too, have the poor?—not the very
poor, whose want of bread of their own baking
forces the oven-doors of the rich—but the comparatively
poor—those who have enough whereby
to live, but nothing left for enjoyment—who
have the necessaries, but not the comforts, nor
the graces, nor the pleasures of life? No one
pities them, though they suffer in their own way
quite as much as those ragged brethren who go
cold and hungry for want of clothing and food.
These others have to offer a brave front to the
world, and to make a little seem a mickle, and
not enough a full measure. It is done only at
the cost of the night’s sleep and the day’s peace—at
the cost of this thing pinched and that pared,
and the deft interlacing of two gaping ends. No
one pities all this, because no one realises it;
and it may be, as has been known too sorrowfully
before now, that those who have almost
more than they can do to live decently are blamed
for parsimony because they do not live luxuriously.</p>

<p>Perhaps no people deserve more sympathy
than those poor gentry whose means fall below
the standard of their original condition, and
thus fail the present needs and degrade the
future position of the family. Gentlefolks born
and bred, with the niceness of feeling and delicacy
of taste included in that term, they are
forced to abandon all the embroideries of class
refinement, and to see their children grow up
with manners below their own mark, and with
an education of less beauty if of as substantial
value. They cannot give them the ‘advantages’
which count for so much. The girls do not learn
music from the best masters, and their painting
lessons leave much to be desired. The boys have
to associate with lads of lower breeding, who
teach them rude ways and vulgar expressions,
so that all the influence of home goes to undo
what that of the school has done. Neither boys
nor girls can learn to ride, to hunt, to shoot, like
their cousins—the rich branch of this unequally
developed family tree; they cannot be taken to
the seaside if they fail in health; and, when
they are ill, they cannot be nursed so sedulously
as if mamma had nothing else to do, and a nurse
with brains and experience could undertake the
rest. They are heavily handicapped all through,
and set to play blindfold with Fortune, who
holds loaded dice and marked cards. From the
first, væ victis! has been recorded against them;
and unless they have exceptional power, on which
we cannot always count, they are foredoomed to
comparative failure, and to that painful process
of winnowing whereby the conquered fall through
the meshes into the abyss, and only the victors
remain safe on the surface.</p>

<p>So it is: Væ victis all through! Nothing
succeeds like success, and nothing is so fatal as
failure. The law is inexorable, and tears cannot
dissolve the links of brass and iron which Fate
has forged. The survival of the fittest is
only a form of væ victis!—the destruction of
the weak, and woe to the conquered! But—and
herein lies the balm to the sore—it
depends greatly on ourselves whether we will
be the conqueror or the conquered; whether
we will make ourselves strong by endeavour,
resolution, self-control, and the cultivation of our
reason and common-sense, or let ourselves go to
ruin by self-indulgence, weakness of will, unreasonable
desires, and the gratification of tastes
which we cannot rightfully indulge, and of
impulses which, even if good, are unworkable
and disastrous. If we resolutely determine that
it shall be <i>Io triumphe!</i> with us, for the most
part we come to our goal; and at the worst we
can always mitigate our failure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">You</span> are a rank heretic, Mac, neither more nor
less,’ remarked the vicar, ‘to say that you don’t
care for our lovely Lake scenery.’</p>

<p>‘But listen, my dear friend,’ protested the
doctor; ‘I never said anything of the kind.
What I did remark was, that your English Lake
scenery was not to be compared to our Scotch
scenery. It’s pretty—very pretty, but when you
have said that, you have said all. If you want
grandeur, if you want sublimity, you must
go’——</p>

<p>‘To Switzerland and see Mont Blanc,’ broke
in Miss Gaisford as she looked up for a moment
from her writing.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. ‘I have reason to
believe that the Swiss scenery has been very
much overrated. And then, just consider the
expense! I’m told that the innkeepers there
are rogues—every man-jack of them. No—no.
I’ve been half over the world in my time, and
all I can say is, that old Scotia’s mountains
and lochs are quite good enough for me.’</p>

<p>The scene was the lawn of the <i>Palatine Hotel</i>,
overlooking a lovely stretch of Windermere, with
the purple-buttressed hills that guard the head
of the lake for an imposing background. The
time was about four o’clock on a sunny afternoon.
Of the three people who had engaged in the
conversation just recorded, one was Dr M‘Murdo,
an army surgeon, the greater part of whose life
had been spent abroad. He had just retired
from the service on a small fortune left him by
a relative, but had not yet quite made up his
mind where to settle for the remainder of his
days. He and the vicar had been great friends
when young men, but had not met for a number
of years till to-day, the doctor having arrived at
the <i>Palatine</i> a few hours ago on a visit to his
friend, who in his turn was spending a portion
of his holiday with other friends at the hotel.</p>

<p>Dr M‘Murdo was well on towards his fiftieth
year. His hair and beard were already grizzled,
while his once fair complexion was deeply tanned
by many years of torrid sunshine. He was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">{632}</span>
tall, lean, high-dried man, somewhat formal and
old-fashioned in his attire, with an expression of
mingled shrewdness and good-humour.</p>

<p>His friend, the Rev. Septimus Gaisford, was
about the same age as himself, and had been the
vicar of a small country parish in the Midlands
for nearly a quarter of a century. He belonged
to the homely, unobtrusive type of country
parson of which, even in these days of unrest
and innovation, specimens happily are still to
be found. He looked after the needs of his
poorer parishioners both spiritual and temporal,
and left the well-to-do pretty much to
themselves. He abounded in good works in a
quiet unostentatious way, while his Sunday
discourses were as homely as himself and such
as could always be ‘understanded of the people.’
Like his friend the doctor, he had never ventured
on the perilous sea of matrimony.</p>

<p>But the vicar was not without a worthy coadjutor
and companion in his parochial labours. His
sister, Miss Gaisford, who was ten years younger
than himself, not only managed his small household,
but looked after such portion of his parish
duties as can often be performed better by a
woman than a man, while it was even whispered
that she occasionally wrote his sermons for him.
So that, all things considered, it was no wonder
the Rev. Septimus had more than once been
heard to remark that ‘Pen’—short for Penelope,
if you please—was far more useful to him than
any curate he had ever had. For the rest, Miss
Pen was a bright-eyed, vivacious little body, not
in the least inclined to be sanctimonious, but
fond of a joke and a laugh, yet with an innate
fund of sympathy about her which by some
attraction of its own seemed to draw all who
were in trouble or difficulty to her side.</p>

<p>On this sunny afternoon, the doctor and the
vicar were seated one at each end of a rustic
bench in the shade of a leafy elm. The former
had his thumb in the pages of a medical review,
to which, however, he was paying but scant
attention; while the latter was mending his
fishing-tackle, for our worthy parson was a
genuine brother of the angle. At a small rustic
table a little distance away sat Miss Gaisford,
busy with her writing, but not so busy as to
preclude her from taking an interest in any topic
which the others might introduce.</p>

<p>Presently she looked up, and as if in answer
to the doctor’s last remark, she said: ‘I am
quite aware that we poor mortals who have the
misfortune to live south of the Tweed are very
badly off as regards many things. Still, we do
now and then manage to produce an article
which even you cool-blooded Northerners can’t
help admiring, and would find it difficult to
excel.’</p>

<p>‘The application, my dear madam, the application.
To what particular article do you
refer?’</p>

<p>‘At present I refer to Madame De Vigne, the
charming widow to whom you paid such very
marked attentions at luncheon.’</p>

<p>‘Ah-ha. I noticed something of that myself,’
chuckled the vicar.</p>

<p>‘Everybody noticed it,’ said Miss Pen emphatically.</p>

<p>Dr Mac rubbed the end of his long nose
with his review and laughed uneasily. ‘Ha, ha!
Very good—very good indeed.’</p>

<p>‘Come now, Mac, you can’t say that you
didn’t cast sheep’s-eyes at her,’ put in the vicar
blandly.</p>

<p>‘Let the pawky Scot deny it if he dare,’
said Miss Pen with a shake of her little fat
curls.</p>

<p>‘Very good, my dear friends; if you choose
to make yourselves pleasant at my expense, you
are welcome to do so. That I admire Madame
De Vigne, I am quite willing to admit. From
what little I have seen of her, she seems to me
a very agreeable person, and if we could trace
back her ancestry, I have no doubt we should
find her to be of Scottish extraction.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, come, Mac, give us poor Southerners credit
for something.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t mind admitting to you, who are
one of my oldest friends, and to Miss Penelope,
that I am getting tired of a bachelor’s life. I
want a home and I want a wife. I have a little
money judiciously invested—and—and I thought,
in fact—that—that’——</p>

<p>‘Don’t be bashful, Mac,’ chimed in the vicar
softly.</p>

<p>‘You thought, in fact, that the charming widow
would make you a charming companion for life,’
put in Miss Pen briskly.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps ay, and perhaps no,’ responded the
doctor quietly.</p>

<p>‘All I can say is, that you may think yourself
a particularly lucky fellow if you succeed in
winning her,’ remarked the vicar.</p>

<p>‘Well, well; I know that both of you are
friends of Madame De Vigne, and that she and
her sister are parishioners of yours. What I
should like you to do is to tell me all you know
about her, and then leave me to consider what
my future course ought to be.’</p>

<p>‘All that we know about Madame De Vigne
is very little,’ remarked the vicar.</p>

<p>‘Very little indeed,’ assented his sister.</p>

<p>‘Still, my dear’—to Miss Pen—‘I am not
aware that we should be abusing any confidence
in telling our friend all that there is to tell, so
far as we know it?’</p>

<p>‘There can be no possible harm in that.
Besides, it will only be charitable to take pity
on the poor man. And now, please not to
interrupt me again for ten minutes at the least.’</p>

<p>‘It is now nearly two years,’ began the vicar,
‘since Madame De Vigne and her sister, Miss
Loraine, came down to Oaklands, bringing with
them a letter of introduction from my London
lawyer, a certain Mr Railton, whom I have
known for a dozen years or more. How Madame
De Vigne came to be known to Railton, or
what he knew with regard to her and her
antecedents, I had not the curiosity to ask
at the time, and I have never since madef it
my business to inquire. It is sufficient to say
that Madame De Vigne had seen advertised as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">{633}</span>
being to let a certain furnished cottage which
she thought would suit her requirements; hence
her visit to Oaklands. The cottage did suit
her. She became its tenant, and there she
and her sister have lived ever since, shunning
rather than courting such society as our neighbourhood
affords, but visiting a good deal among
the sick and poor. One day about six months
ago, while I was out fishing I encountered a
young fellow who was similarly engaged. We
met again and again, striking up an acquaintance
as brother Piscators have a knack of doing, till
finally I invited him to dinner at the vicarage,
on which occasion Penelope there took quite a
fancy to the young man.’</p>

<p>‘Of course I did,’ answered Miss Pen, looking
up quickly. ‘Any one else placed as I was at
the time would have taken a fancy to him. I
was just in want of some one to sit for the
hero of my next novel, and Archie came in
very handy.’</p>

<p>Dr M‘Murdo started. ‘But, my dear Miss
Gaisford, you don’t mean to say that you make
a practice of introducing portraits of your friends
and acquaintances into the stories you write?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t I though! I shall have your portrait
jotted down in my note-book before you are
many hours older. I have no doubt it will
come in useful one of these days.’</p>

<p>‘Good gracious! I hope you won’t paint me
in very dark colours.’</p>

<p>‘Not blacker than you deserve, you may rely
upon it.’ Then to herself she said: ‘Where was
I?—Yes—yes,’ and so went on with her writing.</p>

<p>‘Well, that first visit of young Ridsdale to the
vicarage was but the forerunner of several others,’
resumed the vicar as equably as though he had
not been interrupted. ‘It was there that he
met Madame De Vigne and her pretty sister,
and with the latter he at once fell desperately
in love.’</p>

<p>‘And the young lady fell desperately in love
with him?’</p>

<p>‘That is exactly what came to pass. But I’m
nearly sure the affair might have been nipped
in the bud had not Penelope, with true feminine
perversity and reckless disregard of consequences,
encouraged the two young nincompoops in their
folly.’</p>

<p>‘What else could you expect me to do?’ asked
Miss Pen, without looking up. ‘When I see a
little romance of real life going on under my
very nose, do you think I’m the one to try to
put a stop to it? No, indeed. Besides, it supplied
me with a lot of hints for love-making
scenes; it was what the painters call “a study
from the life.”’</p>

<p>The vicar shrugged his shoulders, as much as
to say: ‘You hear the kind of arguments I am
compelled to listen to.’ Then he again took up
the thread of his narrative. ‘It was not till
after young Ridsdale had become engaged to
Clarice Loraine that we discovered he was the
son of Sir William Ridsdale, a wealthy baronet
of ancient family. The next thing was to obtain
the baronet’s consent to the engagement. It
would appear that the family estates are not
entailed, and, as a consequence, should Master
Archie run counter to his father’s wishes, the
latter can dispose of his property in any way he
may think best. Well, the all-important missive
was written and posted to Mentone, where the
baronet was at that time residing. The answer
was—well, what do you think it was?’</p>

<p>‘A peremptory order by the first post to the
young man to break off the engagement.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing of the kind; but a visit one afternoon
at the vicarage from a certain Colonel
Woodruffe, who had come as plenipotentiary
from the baronet. Sir William was an invalid,
and could not travel, so he had deputed the
colonel to act in his stead. The father had no
doubt in his own mind that his son had fallen
into the toils of an adventuress, and the colonel’s
instructions were to break off the engagement
at any cost, and take Master Archie back with
him.’</p>

<p>‘A sensible man that Sir William. And how
did the affair end?’</p>

<p>‘In a way that you would hardly guess. The
gallant colonel, instead of carrying out his instructions,
and breaking off the engagement between
the young people, ended by falling in love himself
with the fascinating widow and proposing
marriage.’</p>

<p>‘A change of front with a vengeance! And
the answer?’</p>

<p>‘A rejection.’</p>

<p>‘Check for the colonel.’</p>

<p>‘But, old bachelor though you are, Mac, I
daresay you know quite enough of the sex to be
aware that a woman’s No is not always final.
At anyrate, the colonel, who is really a very fine
fellow, is evidently a believer in that doctrine,
seeing that five days ago on his way to Scotland
he stopped here for an hour, had an interview
with Madame De Vigne and renewed his offer.’</p>

<p>‘And the answer to his second offer?’ queried
the doctor eagerly.</p>

<p>The vicar shook his head. ‘Pen, perhaps, can
tell you more about that than I.’</p>

<p>Miss Pen looked up quickly. ‘The answer is
to be given him to-day.’</p>

<p>‘To-day!’</p>

<p>‘The colonel will call here this afternoon on
his way back from Scotland, when Madame
De Vigne has promised that he shall have her
final decision—Yes or No.’</p>

<p>‘So that, my dear Mac,’ said the vicar with a
smile, ‘all things considered, your chance of
winning the widow does not seem a very promising
one.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well,’ answered the doctor sturdily.</p>

<p>‘If a better man than Sandy M‘Murdo wins the
fair prize, why then I’ll—I’ll be his best-man
at the wedding.’</p>

<p>For a minute or two nothing was heard save
the busy scratching of Miss Gaisford’s pen.</p>

<p>‘How will this do, Septimus?’ she asked presently,
and with that she began to read from her
manuscript.</p>

<p>‘“Her eyes of tenderest April blue glance up
shyly into his dark volcanic orbs, in which there
is a half-smothered fire that causes her heart to
flutter like an imprisoned bird. A moment later,
and her slender willowy form is swept up in a
passionate embrace by those stalwart arms, and
Love’s first burning kisses are showered on the
sweet rosebud of her lips.”’</p>

<p>‘Rather tropical, is it not, my dear?’ hinted the
vicar mildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">{634}</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, there’s nothing namby-pamby about my
readers, I assure you,’ answered Miss Pen with
a merry laugh. ‘They like their love-making
warm—and plenty of it.’</p>

<p>For ten minutes longer the busy scratching
went on; then Miss Gaisford laid down her pen
with a sigh of relief. ‘There—not another line
to-day,’ she said. ‘Now that I have got my hero
and my villain in the midst of a terrific encounter
on the verge of a precipice, I can leave them
there for a few hours in comfort.’</p>

<p>‘That seems rather cruel to the pair of them,’
remarked Dr Mac.</p>

<p>‘Oh, heroes and villains are used to that sort of
treatment.—But I hope you will keep my little
secret a secret still, doctor. If it were to reach
the ears of any of the goody-goody people at
home, that the parson’s sister writes foolish love-stories
for young people, what hands would be
uplifted in holy horror—what ejaculations over
her backslidings would be whispered across half
the tea-tables in the parish! Neither the squire’s
wife nor Lady Pinchbeck would ever speak to
me again, and what, oh! what would existence
be worth under such terrible circumstances!’</p>

<p>‘My dear madam, you may rest assured that
your secret is perfectly safe with me.’</p>

<p>‘It will be a bad day for the poor of my parish
when Penelope gives up writing her love-stories,’
remarked the vicar, who was busy with his
tackle book. ‘Every penny she earns goes to
buy blankets, and coals, and such-like comforts
for those who have no money to buy them for
themselves.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Septimus!’ exclaimed Miss Gaisford
with a flaming face.</p>

<p>‘My dear Pen!—Now that Mac has been taken
into our confidence as regards one side of the
question, it is only right that he should be made
acquainted with the other.—But here come our
two truants,’ added the vicar a moment later,
as Mr Archie Ridsdale and Miss Clarice Loraine,
looking somewhat conscious, emerged from one
of the winding walks, and came towards the hotel,
each of them laden with a quantity of wild-flowers,
ferns and grasses.</p>

<p>‘The lovers, eh,’ said Dr Mac, half to himself.
‘A very bonnie young lady—very bonnie
indeed.’</p>

<p>‘We were just thinking of sending the bellman
round,’ said Miss Pen, as the truants came up.
‘Ting-ting-a-ling. Lost since early this morning,
a pair of sweethearts. When last seen, he had
his arm round the waist of she, and she had her
head on the shoulder of he. Whoever will’——</p>

<p>‘Stop, do!’ cried Miss Loraine, as she dropped
her ferns and grasses on the table and stuffed
her fingers into her ears.</p>

<p>‘We have been botanising,’ observed Mr Ridsdale
with the most innocent air imaginable.</p>

<p>‘And a pretty lot of rubbish you seem to have
brought back,’ remarked Miss Pen.</p>

<p>‘Rubbish, indeed! And not one among them
without a long and beautiful Latin name of its
own.—Ask Archie.’</p>

<p>The vicar rose, and addressing the doctor, said:
‘Allow me the pleasure of introducing you to
Miss Loraine.—Clarice, my dear, this is Dr
M‘Murdo, a very old friend of mine.’</p>

<p>‘I had the pleasure of being introduced to
your sister this morning, Miss Loraine, and now
the pleasure is doubled,’ said the doctor with a
touch of old-fashioned gallantry.</p>

<p>‘I am happy to make the acquaintance of any
friend of Mr Gaisford,’ answered Clarice with a
smile and a little blush.</p>

<p>‘Mr Archibald Ridsdale—Dr M‘Murdo,’ said
the vicar. The two men bowed. ‘A capital
fellow to know, so long as you are in good health,
Archie, but a fellow to fight shy of the moment
you begin to feel yourself out of sorts.’</p>

<p>Suddenly a shrill whistle was heard. ‘Here
comes the steamer,’ exclaimed Miss Penelope.
‘I’m going by it as far as Bowness. Any one
going my way?’</p>

<p>‘I will walk with you as far as the landing-stage,
and see you safely on board,’ answered her
brother.</p>

<p>‘That way will suit me as well as another,’
added Dr Mac.</p>

<p>As the two men turned to go, Miss Pen drew
Clarice aside. ‘Any news?’ she whispered.</p>

<p>‘None,’ whispered back the girl with a doleful
shake of the head. ‘If Archie and I only knew
the best or the worst! It is this suspense that’s
so hard to bear.’</p>

<p>‘It seems hard to bear at present, but it will
be delightful to look back upon, by-and-by.’</p>

<p>‘O Miss Penelope! how can that be?’</p>

<p>‘Just now you are in the middle of the first
volume of the romance of your life. Now, I
should like to know how a romance can be worth
anything without suspense, without mystery,
without your being unable to guess what may
happen from one hour to another.’</p>

<p>‘Penelope, you will certainly miss the boat,’
called out her brother, who was already some
distance away.</p>

<p>‘We will talk more of this anon, my dear,’
said Miss Pen hurriedly. ‘Meanwhile, don’t get
downhearted; all will come right at the end
of the third volume: it always does.’ And with
a nod and a smile, the bright little woman tripped
off after her brother and the doctor, and presently
the trio were lost to view down the
winding path that led to the landing-stage and
the lake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="POPULAR_AMUSEMENTS_IN_GERMANY">POPULAR AMUSEMENTS IN GERMANY.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> one thinks of the downright substantial
way in which English people amuse themselves,
with cricket, football, lawn-tennis, rowing, foot-racing,
leaping, &amp;c., all over the kingdom, it is
strange to find so little of active sport of the
kind among our muscular cousins of the Vaterland.
To be sure there are boating clubs and
athletic societies, and gymnasia in the schools
and elsewhere; and soldiers are exercised in
gymnastics, but there is too much of military
stiffness about it. Amusements of a passive
character find most favour. To ‘make’ a walk
in a leisurely fashion, to drive in an open conveyance,
or to sit down in a shady grove to
listen to a band playing, is the most acceptable
mode of enjoying relaxation. With beer
at a penny-farthing a glass, and a tolerable cigar
for a halfpenny, and a military or string band
discoursing sweet music, the time passes pleasantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">{635}</span>
enough. It makes a great difference when you
have not to pay very dearly for your whistle,
and they certainly know how to get the most
for their money in the land of the Teuton.
Many houses of refreshment, even in towns, have
gardens or courtyards thickly planted with trees,
so that their branches meet overhead and form a
pleasant and inviting shade. A large shed, too,
is provided, open on the garden-side, in case of
rain. Frequently, music is introduced, and on
these occasions, an extra halfpenny is charged on
the beer, to cover the expense of the entertainment.
On Sundays and festivals, there is music,
beer, wine, and tobacco everywhere. And yet
these people know how to amuse themselves
without going to excess. Sometimes a tipsy man
is seen, but rarely till very late at night, and
the occurrence is so infrequent, that, compared
with the usages of our own country, it is quite
remarkable.</p>

<p>We have more than once asked the question:
‘Is it that the beer is weaker, or that the German
heads are stronger than the English?’ and we
have been told: ‘Perhaps it is a little of both.’
Perhaps, too, there is something in the fact that
there is in some respects less class distinction in
Germany, and the middle classes may be seen
sipping their wine or coffee in the same place
with their hard-working brethren. Perhaps the
national and natural good opinion, self-respect,
or self-esteem—call it what you will—of the
German helps to keep him straight; and then
he takes his creature-comforts in a staid, stolid,
philosophic way. Noisy fellows there are, of
course; but they do not squabble and fight, as
a rule; the utmost they are guilty of being the
national practice, even at midnight, of singing
rollicking choruses, to the great disturbance
of peace-loving, law-abiding, slumbering citizens.
The fact that soldiers are permitted to wear
their side-arms constantly, speaks volumes for the
sobriety of the men as a class, and redounds
to their credit.</p>

<p>A <i>Turnfest</i> or athletic festival, generally held
on a Sunday, is a great affair, often the event of
the year in a small provincial town. There is
a wonderful display of flags everywhere; and
in the afternoon, a procession of the competitors
and visitors with bands and banners and every
variety of costume, the medals, badges, and
ribbons of former contests being worn with great
ostentation. The most is made of everything;
and shouting and singing and cheering, and
dust and noise, seem to be the order of the
day.</p>

<p>Rowing-matches provoke immense enthusiasm,
and a regatta is an affair that induces the keenest
interest. A people with so much love for the
wonderful and so much regard for themselves,
cannot help throwing into such occasions an
amount of enthusiasm and national pride as would
do credit to the Oxford and Cambridge boatrace
itself. The members of the Boat Club are the
heroes of the hour, and their costumes the object
of great admiration. Though not so peculiar as
the French in this respect, our German neighbours
are nevertheless great in their ‘get-up’ for every
particular sort of occupation or sport that they
engage in. If a man brings down only one snipe
in a day, he looks tremendously cut out for
business notwithstanding, and appears every inch
of him a sportsman when going to or returning
from the ‘hunt,’ as he calls it.</p>

<p>The exercise of riding cannot be properly accomplished
without a complete and appropriate rig-out,
so that even when he is not actually on his
horse, the equestrian gives to all the world the
assurance of a man at home in the saddle. If
spurs and jack-boots do not make a rider, they
at anyrate look very much in earnest. Never
did a be-uniformed people more thoroughly
believe in the dignity of dress and the necessity
for effect than the Germans.</p>

<p>However we may smile at the eccentricities
and oddities of the Germans, we must admit that
they beat us in the provision of cheap music
for the people, most of whom understand and
appreciate it. Every school-teacher is bound to
be a musician and to pass in music, so that
the people have a chance of learning from childhood.</p>

<p>If the Prince of Wales succeeds as well in
popularising the study of music as his father did
in popularising art, we may hope to see before
long a great reformation in the morals of our own
people; and the wandering German bands, composed
of the worst players in their own country—where
they would not presume to play in public—will
no longer be tolerated in England, because
the taste of the people will be educated above such
wretched performances. Good music, then, everywhere
is what is wanted to enable the lower
classes to enjoy themselves rationally, and no
better means of promoting the sobriety of a nation
can be devised. The more the masses are leavened
with a knowledge and love of music, the more
indeed we imitate the Germans in this respect,
the less necessity there will be for restrictive
measures in the way of ‘local option,’ and the
lighter and easier will be the work of temperance
reformers. A great reform will have been
effected. If music can charm savages and snakes,
it can do much more for our toiling, amusement-lacking
countrymen and countrywomen.</p>

<p>The theatre is much patronised in Germany,
the prices being cheap, the music good, and the
performances fair. The play begins at seven,
and ends about nine or half-past. Concerts, too,
both instrumental and vocal, are frequent; every
town has its Choral Society, and every district
its Choral Union, so that there is never any lack
of vocalists of both sexes for the performance
of an oratorio or the celebration of any great
occasion.</p>

<p>Where a people is satisfied with simple pleasures,
these can, of course, be provided at little cost.
Children have their swings, climbing-poles, bowling
alley, merry-go-rounds, horizontal bars, &amp;c.,
in the public gardens; and when one sees
groups of officers deeply interested in the game
of dominoes, it does not cause so much surprise
to witness a huge whirligig worked by
horses or steam, where servant-maids and soldiers
are driven round and round upon painted wooden
horses to the enlivening strains of a barrel organ,
aided by a cornet or two and the universal
drum. This sort of affair is a great attraction to
the masses, and being generally placed near a
beerhouse, admiring friends sit round on benches
with their beakers of frothy beer, their cigars or
large pipes, waiting to take a turn on the machine
after a time. Music everywhere seems to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">{636}</span>
rule—there can never be too much of it to please
the people. Wherever there is a company of
soldiers marching along the road without a band
at their head, they make up for the deficiency by
singing popular melodies and martial songs, keeping
time with their feet; and this always gives
strangers a favourable impression of the hearty,
happy, and even merry German soldier.</p>

<p>A torchlight procession headed by a band of
music is a favourite mode of making a demonstration
on any particular festive occasion; and last,
but not least, is the highly popular serenade.
The Choral Societies of a town will unite—as
was the case in Darmstadt on the night before
the marriage of the granddaughter of Queen
Victoria, the Princess Victoria of Hesse—to the
number of three hundred men, and parade
before the residence of the person they delight
to honour, each member carrying a lighted
Chinese lantern at the end of a stick. A
selection of popular songs and glees suitable
to the occasion is sung, and in many instances
the melodies and words are peculiarly fitting.
One might write a whole chapter about the
amusements of the Carnival time, the masked
balls and street displays; and although these
affairs are somewhat stolid and quite decorous
in character, they contain the elements of simple
fun, innocent recreation, and hearty enjoyment.
Here, again, music is an important factor, for
it enters into everything, and forms the beginning
and the ending of every variety of popular
amusement.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="PRINTERS_ERRORS">PRINTERS’ ERRORS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> must be, to say the least of it, annoying to
the speaker or writer possessed of any degree
of sensitiveness, when he finds his plainest
statements, or it may be his most carefully
prepared flights of fancy, turned into nonsense
by the substitution or omission of a letter in
the printing; and by some unhappy chance it
often seems that the mistake is made in just
such a manner and place as will do the most
mischief. The unlucky poet who wrote,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">See the pale martyr in his sheet of fire!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>must have been completely crushed when the
line appeared as—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">See the pale martyr in his shirt of fire!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We can sympathise also with the poet who,
writing of his love, asserted that he had ‘kissed
her under the silent stars,’ and found the
compositor made him state that he ‘kicked her
under the cellar stairs.’ True, it has been
doubted if these two poets ever existed; but
others, of less mythologic fame, have suffered
as badly at the hands of the printer. Burns,
in a cheap edition of his works, is made to
say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, gin my love were yon red <i>nose</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A well-known temperance lecturer was indignant
at finding the sentiment ascribed to him that
‘drunkenness was jolly,’ whereas he had declared
that it was ‘folly.’</p>

<p>For the explanation of many of these blunders
it is necessary to bear in mind that in setting
up the type the compositor has the various
letters arranged in separate divisions of his case
and selects them one by one as required. Habit
enables him to do this with extreme speed and
accuracy; but it will easily be seen that the
presence of a wrong letter in a division or a
dip into the wrong box may occasion one of
these unhappy blemishes. In this manner we
find oats rendered ‘cats;’ songs, ‘tongs;’ poets,
‘posts;’ or as once happened in the report of
a railway accident, ‘confusions of the limbs’
for ‘contusions of the limbs.’ And by the
substitution of <i>n</i> for <i>h</i>, a newspaper report was
made to state that ‘the people rent the air
with their ten thousand <i>snouts</i>.’</p>

<p>The blame, however, does not always rest with
the compositor. Incorrect spelling and slovenly
writing have much to answer for, especially in
the case of proper names and quotations from
foreign languages. Boerhaave becomes ‘Boershave;’
and <i>Et tu, Brute!</i> ‘Eh, the Brute!’
Authors should remember that the proof-reader
is fallible; he is not, as is sometimes expected,
a ‘Universal Compendium’ of facts, people, places.
If a passage reads clearly and grammatically,
although conveying anything but the sense
intended, it is not to be wondered at that the
error is often undetected until too late. Much
surprise was occasioned by Sir Archibald Alison,
in his <i>History of Europe</i>, including amongst the
persons present at the funeral of the Duke of
Wellington the name of ‘Sir Peregrine Pickle.’
There can be little doubt that the author had
made an unconscious slip, intending to name
Sir Peregrine Acton. Sir Thomas Brassey having
referred in a speech to the <i>Golden Treasury of
Songs and Lyrics</i>, the compositor transformed the
title into the ‘Golden Treasury of Soups and
Cynics.’ A report in a Manchester paper of a
recent dramatic performance mentioned the well-known
farce of <i>No. 1 Round the Corner</i> under the
amusing and suggestive title of ‘<i>No One</i> Round
the Corner.’</p>

<p>Mistakes in punctuation, such as the omission
or misplacing of a comma, may cause serious
alteration to the sense of a passage. The contract
made for lighting the town of Liverpool by wick
lamps, during the year 1819, was rendered void by
the misplacing of a comma in the advertisements,
thus: ‘The lamps at present are about four thousand
and fifty, and have in general two spouts
each, composed of not less than twenty threads of
cotton.’ The contractors would have proceeded
to furnish each lamp with the said twenty
threads; but this being only half the usual
quantity, the Commissioners discovered that the
difference arose from the comma following, instead
of preceding, the word ‘each.’ In the following
instance, it was no doubt a bachelor-compositor
who, in setting up the toast, ‘Woman, without
her, man would be a savage!’ got the comma in
the wrong place, and made the sentence read,
‘Woman, without her man, would be a savage!’</p>

<p>All the above-mentioned errors may fairly be
ascribed to carelessness and mischance. Others,
however, are on record which have been committed
knowingly and intentionally, and so can
scarcely be classed as errors. They have been
mostly connected with Biblical matters, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">{637}</span>
intended to further party interests. It is said
that Field, a printer of the time of Charles I.,
was paid fifteen hundred pounds by the Independents
to alter a single letter in the third
verse of Acts VI., so as to make the word <i>we</i>
read ‘ye,’ and so give the right of appointing
pastors to the people, and not to the apostles.
The deplorable state of the press in Field’s time
may be realised from the fact that Bishop Usher,
on his way to preach at Paul’s Cross, asked at a
stationer’s for a copy of the Bible; and on examining
it, found, to his astonishment, that the text
from which he was about to preach was not in
the book! The well-known ‘Vinegar Bible’ was
published in 1717, and obtains its name from
the Parable of the Vineyard being printed as
the Parable of the <i>Vinegar</i>. One of the most
wilful alterations of the text, and one which
cost its perpetrator her life, was committed by
the widow of a German printer. One night,
while an edition of the Bible was being printed
in her house, she took the opportunity of altering
the word <i>Herr</i> into ‘Narr,’ making the verse
read, ‘he shall be thy <i>fool</i>,’ instead of ‘he shall
be thy <i>lord</i>.’</p>

<p>The celebrated Bibles of Sixtus V. are eagerly
sought for by collectors. Their sole fame is the
multitude of errata which crowd their pages,
notwithstanding that His Holiness Sixtus V.
carefully superintended every sheet as it passed
through the press, and finally prefixed to the
first edition a bull forbidding any alteration in
the text.</p>

<p>A curious jumble appeared in a cabled critique
of Mr Irving’s acting on one of his appearances
in the States. Instead of saying that ‘the
taste for Irving, like that for olives, must be
cultivated,’ the critic was represented as giving
utterance to the incomprehensible assertion that
‘the toast for Irving, like the toast for olives,
must be cut elevated.’</p>

<p>A Glasgow divine, and one of Her Majesty’s
chaplains in Scotland, was lately reported as
saying that ‘personally he violated the Lord’s
Day as much as any member of the Court.’
‘Venerated’ was probably the word actually
employed by the reverend gentleman.</p>

<p>Similarly, in an edition of <i>Men of the Time</i>
published in 1856, the then Bishop of Oxford
is thus described: ‘Oxford, Bishop of (Rt. Rev
Samuel). A more kind-hearted and truly benevolent
man does not exist. A sceptic as regards
religious revelations, he is yet an out-and-out
believer in spirit manifestations.’ This description
really belonged to ‘Owen (Robert) of Lanark.’
The edition was soon suppressed, but not before
the Bishop had possessed himself of a copy for
his private library.</p>

<p>Although both the chaplain and the bishop
had reason to complain of their treatment,
it must have been considerably more astonishing
and mortifying for Herr Franz Liszt, who
is still delighting his musical admirers with his
productions, to find that in Haydn’s <i>Dictionary
of Dates</i> (1870) he is represented as dying in
October 1868.</p>

<p>The Queen’s Speech at the opening of a recent
session of parliament was hurriedly published
in a Scotch newspaper without being revised by
the press-corrector, and Her Majesty, instead of
saying that certain negotiations ‘will, I doubt
not, lead to satisfactory results,’ was reported
as saying, ‘will, I doubt, not lead to satisfactory
results.’ So much for the misplacing of a
comma!</p>

<p>With increased literature have come better
systems of ‘reading’ and correcting, and greater
accuracy has been attained. Such mistakes as
above quoted are exceptional, and the morning
newspaper may now be read week after week
with but few misprints. A good example
of accuracy in printing tables of figures—in
which it is so difficult to avoid errors—may
be seen in <i>Bradshaw’s Railway Guide</i>, every
monthly part of which contains from seven to
eight hundred thousand figures. Astronomical
and mathematical tables require great care in
printing, and very few are issued which can
be relied upon as absolutely correct. Charles
Babbage superintended the production of a set
of trigonometrical tables in 1827 which perhaps
stand unrivalled in this respect. They were
prepared for the Ordnance Survey of England
and Ireland, and a limited number of copies
printed—it is said only thirty. They consist of
tables of logarithms and log. sines, tangents,
cosines and cotangents, <i>to every second</i>. Roughly
speaking, they contain about six millions of
figures. The proof-sheets were revised by several
sets of readers, and were carefully examined and
compared with other tables no less than seven
times. From Mr Babbage’s preface, we learn
that after the final stereotyping, seven errors
were found in the logarithms and one in the
differences. These being corrected, the stereotyped
sheets were hung up in the Hall at Cambridge
University, and a reward offered to any one
who could find an inaccuracy. Since their first
issue in 1827, no error has been discovered, and
it may reasonably be concluded that they are
absolutely correct.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_KING_COUNTRY">‘THE KING COUNTRY.’</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> recent visit of King Tawhiao to this country
has awakened a deep and widespread interest in
New Zealand and its inhabitants. The Maori
king has been fêted and feasted far beyond his
desires, and has paid the penalty of greatness.
But he has suffered martyrdom in a good cause;
and if he has not succeeded in bringing the
wrongs of the Maoris home to the Pakehas, he has
certainly aroused a very general curiosity as to
the character and resources of the mysterious
‘King Country’ of which he is the titular
chieftain. The publication of Mr J. H. Kerry-Nicholls’s
volume of travels—entitled <i>The King
Country, or Explorations in New Zealand</i> (London:
Sampson Low)—in this unknown region is, therefore,
peculiarly well timed. Until within the
last few years, ‘the King Country’—as a vast
tract of the finest land in North Island is still
known—was a <i>terra incognita</i> to Europeans.
Rivalries of race constituted a barrier more impassable
than the <i>aukati</i> line itself, which separates
the Maori lands from the European portion
of the colony, and is marked on the one side by
the farms and homesteads of the settlers, and on
the other by the huts of the natives. In its vast
forests, over its precipitous mountains, along its
trackless plains, the natives alone wandered. It
was an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, a fastness in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">{638}</span>
aboriginal sovereignty sat enthroned, deaf to all
the offers of civilisation.</p>

<p>It was through this unknown country that
Mr Kerry-Nicholls pushed his way in company
only with an interpreter. With but three horses,
which were ultimately reduced to two, he accomplished
more than six hundred miles of travel,
discovered many new streams, penetrated almost
inaccessible regions of mountainous forest, found
extensive plains, traced the sources of three of
the principal rivers of the colony, examined the
unknown shores of its largest lake, ascended one
of its highest mountains, experienced degrees of
temperature varying from eighty degrees in the
shade to twelve degrees below freezing-point, and
successfully traversed from south to north a territory
with an area of ten thousand square miles,
which had been, from the early history of the
colony, rigorously closed to Europeans. It is
scarcely necessary to add that the records of
these wanderings constitute a singularly interesting
volume of discovery and adventure, which
can hardly fail to prove of some practical utility
to the colony, and a welcome contribution to
geographical science.</p>

<p>‘The King Country’ comprises one of the
finest tracts of land not only in New Zealand,
but in some respects in the southern hemisphere.
It is much more than merely picturesque, and
in this respect alone it can compete with the
finest scenery the world can produce. Its
natural advantages are of the highest order.
It is throughout well watered, and in parts
exuberantly fertile; while even the mountains
are richly clothed with forest trees and shrubs.
The southern portion is drained by the Whanganui
River, which is fed by many tributaries,
flowing from the highest mountain-ranges in
the central and southern divisions of the island;
while the Mokau River and its affluents flow
from the central region to the coast. In the
north, the Waipa and numberless minor streams
flow from the mountains into the Waikoto River
itself, which has from time immemorial been
renowned in Maori fable and romance. Again,
more than a dozen streams flow into Lake Taupo,
an immense reservoir, some twenty-four miles
long by fourteen broad, which lies almost in
the midst of the central tableland; while the
Waikoto is the only effluent river. During the
rainy season, the waters of this lake, having
only this one outlet, rise rapidly; and with
the continuance of heavy winds, its waves are
lashed into fury, and break upon its shores with
all the force of a raging sea.</p>

<p>Geologically speaking, this district presents
problems of surpassing interest. Here can be
seen side by side the relics of the stupendous
action of volcanic fires, and of the scarcely
less potent force of the glacier. It is contended
that the formation of North Island must
be attributed to submarine volcanic eruptions,
which, perhaps by slow degrees, perhaps rapidly,
forced upwards the Taupo tableland. These
fires bursting again through the plains, caused
mountains to rise up in the form of serrated
ridges and truncated cones, which poured
out streams of lava and enormous deposits of
pumice over the surrounding country. Probably
the basin of the lake was once an active crater,
from which the first vast pumice-plains flowed;
while later, the mighty Ruapehu, and, when
it became extinct, the still active Tongariro,
became the outlet of the volcanic fire. That
this element is still largely active in many
parts of the country is shown by the geysers,
solfataras, fumaroles, and hot springs which
form one of the characteristic features of North
Island. Thus the ‘lake country’—as the district
round Lake Rorotua is commonly known—is
‘a region of eternal fire.’ The conditions of
existence here are certainly novel. The natives
bathe in such of the thermal springs as are of
suitable temperature, at all times of the day, and
in a very primitive fashion. In others, again,
they cook their food and warm their houses by
the same means.</p>

<p>These natural phenomena occur in many other
districts, such, for instance, as that round Lake
Rotokawa, and the districts near the native
settlement of Tokanu, on the south side of Lake
Taupo; while on the northern slope of Tongariro
are some of the largest and most active
boiling springs in the country. Moreover, the
mountains possess all the rock formations in
which gold, coal, iron, and other minerals are
found to exist. Thus, the Kaimanawa Mountains,
which are situated in almost the centre of the
island, and stretch across the great central tableland
to an extent of eighty miles, offer a peculiarly
rich field to the geologist. Mr Kerry-Nicholls
reports the existence of abundant auriferous
indications, and confidently expresses his
opinion that here lies a probable Eldorado.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to do more than mention
the adventurous journeyings recorded in this
volume. Frustrated, owing to disputes between
the natives and the colonial government, in an
attempt to enter ‘the King Country’ from the
north, the traveller successfully essayed to pass
the southern boundary-line. By throwing himself
upon the good-will of the natives, going fearlessly
among them, respecting their customs, and following
as nearly as possible their mode of life, and,
in fact, for the time becoming a Maori, he succeeded
at a time when many Europeans would
not only have failed, but probably have paid
the extreme penalty for their rashness. In one
case, it is true, he only achieved his purpose by
dint of exercising the greatest secrecy. Tongariro
is <i>tapu</i>, or strictly sacred, in the eyes of the
Maoris, and could only be ascended by a European without
their knowledge. This is one of
the most perfect volcanic cones in the world.
But the resources of this rich district, from whatever
point of view they may be considered, are
still awaiting development. Its flora and fauna
have still to be collected and classified. Its
agricultural and industrial resources are still
unknown; but we have evidence to show that
these are worthy of attention.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MOULMEIN_ELEPHANTS">THE MOULMEIN ELEPHANTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> time ago there was a discussion in the
learned journals regarding ‘intellect in brutes;’
and I thought then, as I think now, that much
of the controversy depended on the definition we
assign to the word ‘intellect.’ Some say that it
is merely an exaltation of the natural instinct of
the brute; others, that it is an exhibition of true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">{639}</span>
reason. But then, what is instinct? Some arguers
mystify their hearers, and exhibit their own ignorance
of the subject by replying: ‘Instinct is
only that in animals which we call reason in
man.’ Well, this is not the place to argue the
subject; but I shall exhibit certain facts, observed
by myself, in the behaviour of the elephants
employed in the Moulmein timber-yards, and
leave my readers to judge whether they were
due to instinct or reason.</p>

<p>Anchored abreast of Aga Synd Abdul Hosein’s
timber-yard, and within bare swinging distance of
the shore, I had ample opportunities of minutely
observing and recording the marvellous illustrations
of the elephant’s intelligence. These animals
are largely employed in the timber-yards, and
their functions consist in helping to embark and
disembark the huge teak-logs, or move them
about the yard; in fact, without them work
would be at a stand-still. What struck me at
once was the wonderful combination of enormous
power with the gentlest, most loving docility.
Here were huge logs being moved about as if
they were matches, and yet with the utmost
regard to any one in the way. A case in point.
We were landing one day at the Aga’s wharf,
and found that the ebbing tide had left a thick
layer of treacherous slime on the wooden slope,
rendering it impossible for a lady to land. Seeing
this, the manager called out to a mahout or
driver, and in a moment his elephant pushed
a log down the slope, just stopping short of the
boat, and affording the lady a dry surface to step
out upon. There must have been intellect in
this act; for the great log was not pushed down
at random on the wharf, nor into collision with
the boat, but exactly at the right spot and into
the right place.</p>

<p>All elephant-work is performed either by the
trunk or right foot in pushing; by trunk and
tusks combined, as in carrying logs; or by the
strength of the whole body in dragging. Dragging-elephants
are furnished with a light wooden pack-saddle,
on which the mahout sits sideways, and
to which the traction-chain is attached. This is
Y-shaped, the leg being greatly prolonged and
ending in a hook. Let us watch the handling of
this log—twenty feet long, by sixteen inches
square—which has to be dragged across the yard.
The chain is passed round it by an assistant and
then firmly hooked; and now the elephant has to
do the rest. His first action is to get his hind-legs
well within the V of the chain, and then
he starts, the log helplessly following. Arrived
at its destination, the elephant disencumbers
himself of the log by unhooking the chain with
the finger of his trunk, and then pulling it from
under the log, or pushing the latter to one side.
Now, mark what was involved in this apparently
simple operation, the sole guidance to which was
either the voice of the mahout, a pat from his
stick, or a tap from his heels. First, there was
the getting inside the V. Why did the old fellow
do that? He has learned from experience that
if he did not, traction would be interfered with,
and his legs rubbed by the chain. Was not his
action, therefore, dictated by reason? Secondly,
there was the unhooking of the chain, which
instinct never could have prompted. Imitation
was at work; the elephant had seen that the
unhooking of the chain liberated the log, and
had learned to follow the example; showing
thereby the domination of reason.</p>

<p>Here are some logs being adjusted on the
wharf-slope. Note the ease with which the
elephant pushes each into its place with, apparently,
the slightest movement of trunk or foot.
Mark this one, which, by a greater than necessary
exercise of force, has become tilted up
against its fellow. The elephant has noted it
too, and half-kneeling, and getting his tusks
under it, he pulls the log backwards a little,
and it drops square with its fellow. What
dictated that action? Mathematical order and
precision belong to the bee, and are said to be
instinctively implanted in that humble animal;
but could there have been anything in this
elephant’s antecedents to have prepared it for rearranging
a dislocated log? Surely the impulse
seized it at the moment, and must have been due
to a sense of order or tidiness implying the
presence of reason. Odd lengths of log, varying
from four to six feet, are carried about the yard
by elephants, a species of work which is distasteful
to them, as exhibiting their awkward points.
Indeed, they evidently feel degraded by it, for
they set to work with an air of resignation quite
foreign to their shifting or dragging feats. There
they rejoice in their great strength, and are
fond of exhibiting it. Here, little strength is
needed; but the operations involve roughish
treatment of the nose, and we know that all
animals, including man, are very particular as
to how their noses are handled.</p>

<p>The elephant is proud of his strength, but
sensitive with regard to his trunk, especially
when that delicate organ is brought to bear upon
any rough work; and as the securing of a log
between the trunk and tusks necessitates a large
amount of awkward movement, I noticed that
the selected elephant approached the job with
reluctance. Resigned to his fate, he half-kneels
before the odious object, and gets the points of
his tusks under it; then he wriggles it up the
ivory tramway with his trunk, and secures it
therewith <i>in situ</i>. His troubles now commence;
for on rising to his feet, the hateful log, obeying
the laws of gravity, at once tends to drop; and
to obviate this, the poor brute has to raise his
head on high. Thus constrained, he commences
his march with slow stateliness, as if to make the
best of a bad job, and not let the world at large
know that he is virtually walking blindfold.
And so he is; for the elevation of his head upsets
the axis of his vision, and he has to walk more
by touch than by sight.</p>

<p>I have thus attempted to describe the main
duties which elephants have to discharge in the
timber-yards, and I have mentioned that they are
guided by the voice, stick, or heels of the mahout.
Watching them from shipboard, you are quite
close enough to note every movement of the
animal, but not sufficiently near to catch the
signal, so that the elephantine actions seem purely
automatic, and therefore the more astonishing.
But when you are alongside the animal, and can
see and hear the simple signals under which he
works, you are equally astonished at the thorough
manner in which he understands what he is
expected to do, and the very little prompting he
requires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">{640}</span></p>

<p>On one occasion, I arranged with a mahout to
bring up his elephant to where I was standing,
that I might indicate the work to be done, the
mahout to be absolutely silent. Standing by
a six-foot log, I beckoned to the mahout, and
up came the elephant. Arrived at the spot,
and being without chains, he must have opined
that dragging was not intended. There remained,
then, pushing or carrying, the latter operation
being the one which the sagacious creature saw
was intended, for he proceeded at once with
his awkward preparations for carrying it away.
Throughout this test the mahout was absolutely
silent, and, as far as I could see, quite passive.
The result of it was that the elephant divined:
what I, a stranger, wished it to do, and did it.</p>

<p>On another occasion, I applied the test to a
difficult object, an eighteen-inch cube of teak,
which the dear old fellow at once arranged to
carry off; but how to do it, he could not at
first determine. As his tusks diverged more
than eighteen inches, they were no support,
and the many sharp corners of the cube sorely
tried the delicate trunk. After some failures,
he managed to seize the fragment by the centre,
and then raise it up below the tusks against
his lower lip. As he had virtually accomplished
the task, I discontinued the experiment,
expressing my satisfaction and delight to the
manager, who somewhat damped my ardour by
informing me that the mahout, while abstaining
from use of voice or stick, might have conveyed
his wishes to the elephant by pressure with his
heels!</p>

<p>But a moment’s reflection increased my admiration
at the elephant’s intelligence, for, allowing
that the mahout’s heels <i>had</i> pressed his side,
how could such pressure inform him that he was
neither to drag nor push, but carry? Surely
the mahout could not have possessed a code
of pressure-signals with which he had indoctrinated
the elephant in prospect of curious visitors.
If he had, then it must have included
voice and stick signalling as well, to either of
which I might have resorted. No; I believe
that the elephant acted independently of signals,
and reasoned on what he had to do, by what
was laid before him.</p>

<p>Hitherto, we have seen the elephant in the
yard; let us follow him into the mill, and there
admire the triumph of reason over instinct. We
all know how naturally timid and nervous the
elephant is, and how susceptible to noise. Well,
watch this noble old fellow solemnly dragging
in a huge log to the sawmill. Onward he
moves, undismayed by the horrid panting of the
engine or the screeching of the saws. Instinct
would have tempted him to turn tail and flee
from the noisy turmoil; reason keeps him at
his task, confident that amid the uproar and
apparent confusion, perfect order and safety prevail.
And so, with flapping ears and swaying
trunk, he yields up his log to the grip of the
remorseless saw, and goes off unconcerned to find
a fresh victim. It was very pleasing to see that
the Aga’s elephants were kindly treated and
well cared for; the goading <i>ánkūs</i> (iron hook;
and prod) was nowhere to be seen. A daily
as well as a rigidly observed weekly rest was
secured to them; besides, their cleanliness is
well looked after; and morning and evening
they are taken into the river to be well scrubbed,
the termination of each bath being a triple dive,
which they enjoy immensely.</p>

<p>On a second visit to Moulmein, I noticed
another totally different illustration of confiding
reason in the elephant. We were at anchor in
the river in a strongly flowing tide, when a
deeply sunk raft laden with green forage, two
men, and two elephants, swept swiftly past.
The elephants stood motionless and quite unconcerned,
knowing that they were under secure
pilotage, and quite safe as long as they remained
quiet. If they had proved restless, the raft must
have come to grief.</p>

</div>


<p>According to the <i>Scientific American</i>, the gum-arabic
supply appears to have been in a great
measure cut off owing to the state of affairs in
the Soudan. It says: ‘Gum-arabic comes almost
exclusively from the Soudan, and owing to the
operations of El Madhi, there have been no
receipts of any consequence for a year past. In
confectionery it makes about thirty per cent. of
the best quality of gum-drops, marsh-mallow,
and jujube paste. The annual supply from the
Soudan has heretofore been from twenty to
twenty-five thousand bags of four to six hundred
pounds each, and there is usually a stock held
in London about equal to one year’s receipts.
This reserve is now about exhausted, and the
gum has been steadily advancing in price from
the ordinary figures of fourpence to fivepence per
pound, until it now commands from one shilling
and threepence to two shillings, according to
quality.’</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
